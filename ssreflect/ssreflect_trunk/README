INSTALLATION

(1) If you haven't done so yet compile Coq in its source directroy:

  ./configure -local -opt
  make

(2) Put the file ssreflect.ml4 in the coq source directory. Now build
the ssreflect toplevel:

  make ssreflect.cmx
  bin/coqmktop -opt -o bin/ssrcoq ssreflect.cmx


USAGE

The program ssrcoq will act as a toplevel. There is no extra command
to compile a file. Do "ssrcoq -compile fermat.v" to generate
fermat.vo.

Tested with coq-trunk SVN revision 9887.
