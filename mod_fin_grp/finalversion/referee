Paper: 32
Title: A modular formalisation of finite group theory


-------------------- review 1 --------------------

OVERALL RATING: 0 (borderline paper)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (expert)
----------------------- REVIEW --------------------

Short summary of the paper:

The authors describe a formalization of finite group theory in Coq,
including proofs of significant theorems: the Sylow theorems, the
Frobenius lemma and the Cauchy-Frobenius lemma.


Strength of the paper:

It devotes much space to "small scale reflection" in Coq, which proved
invaluable in the proof of the 4-Color Theorem. This documentation, if it
has not been published elsewhere, is good to know about. The proofs of the
group theory theorems clearly represent a considerable amount of work.


Weakness of the paper:

Little of the paper is devoted to the formalization of group theory, as
promised by the title. The first six pages are devoted to techniques to
subvert the constructive logic of Coq. To get classical reasoning, a
decidable boolean type is used instead of the type of propositions. To get
extensional set equality, finite sets are coded as lists. Groups have to
be finite. These aspects of the formalization are deeply unappealing. For
example, the Cartesian product of two sets has to be coded in an
unintelligible form. I found the discussion of quotient groups difficult
to understand, but the main point is that the traditional definitions
cannot be used. It is clear that intensional equality has no place in
mainstream mathematics.

The paper does not address the crucial issues in the formalization of
algebra, e.g.:

(1) Do we get a nice notation? Do we have to write identity(G) instead of
1 and product(G,x,y) instead of x*y? Coq appears to solve this problem,
though I did not notice the description of how this is done.

(2) What happens to the notation when there are two groups with different
carriers? Even if (1) is satisfied we might still start seeing identity(G)
and identity(H) because they can't both be 1. The paper doesn't address
this.

(3) How does it handle the telescoping of concepts, e.g. Monoid, Group,
Abelian Group, Ring, Integral Domain, Field? The paper says nothing here,
and its insistence on finite carriers prevents a general treatment.

The section on standard theorems of group theory demonstrates that the
authors have put great efforts into this project, but it does not
demonstrate that the formalization is adequate. These theorems are heavily
combinatorial, i.e. they rely on elaborate counting arguments. The
description uses standard mathematical notation and shows little of its
appearance in Coq. More to the point would be simple theorems such as "the
product of two groups is a group" and then "there is an isomorphism
between (G1*G2)*G3 and G1*(G2*G3)", when we would see how natural the Coq
encoding is.

Presentation / Writing style:

Acceptable, given that none of the authors are native English speakers,
though there are numerous typos. It requires careful proof-reading by a
native speaker.



Comments to the authors:

It is necessary to motivate the work better. The choice of Coq is
difficult to justify when Mizar has much better support for algebraic
hierarchies. How does Coq make this work easier, especially in view of the
many ways that Coq makes it more difficult? Proving the Feit-Thompson
theorem also needs better motivation; the length of the original proof is
not sufficient justification. Compare with the motivation for proving the
4CT, where (1) the original proof was not regarded as satisfactory and (2)
the computational power of Coq was crucial to making a satisfactory proof.

Under related work you should mention Kobayashi (see "Formalization of
Hensel's Lemma" by
Hidetune Kobayashi, Hideo Suzuki and Yoko Ono, TPHOLs 2005, Emerging
trends). This formalizes group theory in Isabelle/HOL up to the
Jordan-HÅ¡lder theorem.

You refer to the development as "modular" and "compositional" in the title
and abstract, but these points don't appear to be taken up in the text
itself.

OVERALL RATING: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 2 (medium)
----------------------- REVIEW --------------------

Short summary of the paper:

This paper describes a formalization in Coq of some elementary theorey
of finite groups, culminating in several standard results including
Sylow theorem, Frobenius's lemma, and Cauchy-Frobenius lemma.  The
authors' ultimate goal is to formalize the Feit-Thompson theorem (that
every finite group of odd order is solvable), whose informal version
is 255 pages long and which forms one of the cornerstones of the
classification of finite simple groups.


Strength of the paper:

This work is clearly one of the most complete formalizations of
elementary group theory so far.


Weakness of the paper:

After reading this paper, I cannot help but wonder whether the
constructive type theory on which Coq is based is an asset or a
liability in serious formalized mathematics projects like this one.  A
lot of efforts in this work seem to me to be devoted to making the
tyep theory of Coq to behave more like classical type theory or set
theory.  In the conclusion the authors write:

    Using decidable types and relying heavily on rewriting for our
    proofs gives a 'classicalâ%Gâ‚¬%@“¢â flavour to our development that is more
    familiar to what can be found in provers like Isabelle [15] or Hol
    [10] than what is usually done in Coq. An indication of the
    conciseness of our proof scripts is given by the following figure.
    [ ... ]

Alas, why doesn't one just use classical type theory?  Indeed, why
doesn't one just use classical set theory, as in virtually all books
on group theory?  What is to be gained from using constructive type
theory in this endeavor?

OVERALL RATING: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 3 (high)
----------------------- REVIEW --------------------

Short summary of the paper:

Formalizing mathematics is tricky, with lots of design choices.  Making a
bad choice early on can make both specifications and proofs more and more
difficult as the mathematical development continues.  This paper describes a
formalization of finite group theory, along with some of the design choices
considered and why they settled on the ones presented.  Using the
formalisation in the Coq system some significant theorems were stated and
proved.


Strength of the paper:

The paper lays out the design choices nicely, in a way that could aid
someone who wants to design their own formalization, even outside of Coq -
though many of the techniques do rely on features of Coq, in particular the
small scale reflections that play a key role in making both the
specifications and proofs more palatable.  The Sylow theorems, Frobenius
lemma, and Cauchy-Frobenius lemma are substantial proofs that were done
using this formalization.  The authors have good reason to believe their
formalization is robust.


Weakness of the paper:

About the only weakness I could see in this approach is that it would be
difficult to view finite groups as a subcategory of groups, as the
formalisation has finiteness built in at the beginning.  But this is a minor
issue, and could probably be handled using isomorphisms anyway.


Presentation / Writing style:

Well written and balanced, with just the right level of detail.
There were a number of minor typos, listed below.


Comments to the authors:

p1: "We comment some of" ==> "We comment on some of"

p2: "we comment the fundamental" - same, needs "on"
    "of the example of script" - remove second "of"
    "frequents cases" - should be "frequent"
    "In practice, these two tactics" - should be "tacticals"
    "very rare than more than" - first "than" should be "that"

p3: "convivial" - I'm not sure this is the word you really want
       here - look it up.
    "number of times than the tactic" - "than" should be "as"

p5: "choose as a default choice" - remove "choice"

p6: "operations that the ones proposed" - "that" should be "as"
    "In the same way than eqType" - "than" should be "that"

p7: "Lemms like smulgP belongs to" - should be "belong"

p8: "Like this, we avoid" ==> "In this way we avoid"
    "to insure well-formedness" - should be "ensure"

p11: The "p" in "and p does not divide s" is in the wrong font.

p12: "simpler argument that the one" - "that" should be "than"
     "p-tuples are graphs of function which domain"
       ==> "p-tuples are graphs of functions whose domain"

p13: "then t in equal" - "in" should be "is"

p14: "fixed by each of the isometry" -
          either make it "isometries" or omit "of the"
     "to gave us feedback" - should be "give"
     "one of the most difficult aspect of" - should be "aspects"
     "try and go" - "trial and error" is a somewhat better phrase here

OVERALL RATING: 3 (strong accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 3 (high)
----------------------- REVIEW --------------------

Short summary of the paper:

 This paper presents a formalisation of some basic lemmas of finite
group theory. This is a kind of test to see if the approach can scale
up to bigger examples.


Strength of the paper:

 Very good example of formalisation in -intensional type theory- This
involves non trivial design decisions. In particular the restriction
to sets with decidable equality. The representation of quotient is also
a non trivial step.

Weakness of the paper:

 Are the proofs readable?? (Comparison with proofs in Isar for instance?)

Presentation / Writing style:

Comments to the authors:

 I did not understand the definition of setType d. What is an "intensional
set"??

 Maybe there can be a reference to

 Hedberg, Michael A coherence theorem for Martin-LÃ¶f's type theory.
 J. Funct. Programming  8  (1998),  no. 4, 413--436

since his result is used in Lemma eq_irrelevance

 I did not understand the discussion at the end: what is an "object" in
"13 lines per object/7 lines per object"?

 There should be more general discussions about why it is interesting
to do the formalisation in (intensional) type theory as opposed to, say, in
classical set theory. Probably a reason one can mention is that there
are possible connections with computational group theory in computer
algebra.


 Here are other comments from another reader of the paper:

 General remark:
I think that theorems should be stated and not only referred to by names
such as
"Feit-Thompson theorem" or "Third fundamental isomorphism theorem".

In the case of Feit-Thompson there really is no doubt as to what is meant but
including the very short statement will save the reader from looking it up.

Concerning the isomorphism theorems I wonder if there really exists a a
generally
aggreed upon standard for how many they are and how to number them.

In the following, comments begin with the "prompt" symbol  "mh>".

Section 2.2 Views
 Explain the notions of "view" and "view lemma".

Section 3.1 Graphs of function and intensional sets
Paragraph beginning with "Note that on the left-hand ..."
Sentence "For example, (setType d) corresponds to (set d).":
 What graph operation is "(setType d)"?
 What function operation is "(set d)"?

Next sentence:
 Explain (somewhere) the notion of "intensional set".

Section 3.2 Groups
Shortly after "Lemma smulgP: ..."
Sentence "Finally, a group is defined as boolean predicate, satisfied by
sets ...":
 Check the language in this sentence.

Section 3.3 Quotients
Last paragraph:
 Explain (somewhere) the notion of "intensional set".

Section 3.4 Group morphisms
In general:
 The informal explation of the formalisation of morhisms do not seem to be
consistent with the formulas given.

Second paragraph
Sentence: "Thus, the values of a given function alone should be enough to
determine
the largest group on which this function may be seen as a morphism."
 The notion of "the largest group" is strange, since, in the general case,
it is
possible that such group (on which the funtion is a mprphism) does not
exist at
all.

After third paragraph. "Definition ker(f elt -> elt') := ..."
 I cannot parse the right hand side "{x:elt \subset {y:elt, ...}}". I
belive that
what is meant is "{x|\forall y. f(x*y) == f(y)} ".

Last paragraph and the "third isomorphism theorem":
 In my book this is the "second isomorphism theorem".
 It is interesting that the lemma works with the week assumption of H being a
subgroup of K instead of the theorems stronger assumption that H is a normal
subgroup of K.
 Is subset inclusion really the appropriate relation in "Lemma mdom_f3"?

Section 4.1 Sylow theorems
Third paragraph from the end:
 What is "the class equation"?

"
