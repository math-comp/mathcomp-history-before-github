In this paper, we present a formalisation of elementary group
theory done in {\sc Coq}. This work is the first milestone
of a long-term effort to formalise Feit-Thompson theorem.
As our further developments will heavily rely on this initial base,
we took special care to articulate it in the most
compositional way.
