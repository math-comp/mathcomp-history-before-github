Feit Thompson Theorem 
---------------------
It is our great pleasure to announce that the proof of the Odd Order Theorem
(due to Walter Feit and John G. Thompson) has now been completely
machine-checked using the Coq proof assistant.
This concludes a 6 year effort by the Mathematical Components team lead by
Georges Gonthier (MSR Cambridge) at the Inria Microsoft Research Joint Centre.
